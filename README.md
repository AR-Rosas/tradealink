### Accessibility & Performance

- Mobile-first design using Nuxt UI primitives
- Pre-rendered static routes for quick loads (landing, services, directory, blog)
- Minimal external scripts beyond Tally for forms
- YAML-driven content for easy updates without code changes

## Tech Stack

- Nuxt 4 (app directory) + TypeScript
- `@nuxt/ui` for layout and components (auto-imported with tree-shaking enabled)
- `@nuxt/content` with a validated content schema (`content.config.ts`)
- Iconify JSON packages for icons (Lucide, Simple Icons)
- Automatic component detection enabled for optimal bundle size

## Performance Optimizations

- **Tree-shaking**: Nuxt UI's experimental component detection automatically includes only the components used in the project
- **Pre-rendering**: Static routes pre-rendered at build time for instant page loads
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only essential UI components are included in the bundle
- **Iconify**: On-demand icon loading with automatic purging of unused icons

## Safe Changes Checklist

Before pushing a change, verify:

- Builds: `pnpm build` succeeds; `pnpm preview` runs locally.
- Lint & Types: `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` pass (stylistic rules include `braceStyle: '1tbs'`, `commaDangle: 'never'`).
- UI Consistency: Prefer Nuxt UI primitives (`UApp`, `UHeader`, `UMain`, `UFooter`, `UCard`, etc.) and props (`color`, `variant`, `size`). Keep theme colors from `app/app.config.ts` (`ui.colors.primary='green'`, `neutral='slate'`).
- Content Schema: Any new markdown under `content/directory/` satisfies `content.config.ts` (zod) fields.
- Directory Flow: Preserve localStorage gate `tradealink-directory-unlocked` and Tally IDs unless intentionally changed.

## App Structure

```

### Architecture Highlights

- Global shell at `app/app.vue` using `UApp`, `UHeader`, `UMain`, `UFooter`.
- Styling via `assets/css/main.css` and Nuxt UI theme in `app/app.config.ts`.
- Content powered by `@nuxt/content`; markdown lives under `content/**`, queried via `queryCollection`.
- Routing & SSG: `nuxt.config.ts` prerenders `/`, `/directory`, and `/directory/**` via `routeRules`.

## Directory Content Model

Defined in `content.config.ts` as a `page` collection sourced from `content/directory/*.md`.

Required frontmatter fields:

```yaml
slug: string
title: string
description: string
category: string
date: YYYY-MM-DD (coerced)
tags: string[] (optional, defaults to [])
heroImage: url (optional)
readingTime: number (optional)
author: { name: string; role?: string; avatar?: url } (optional)
```

Each markdown file then contains link sections. Example:

```md
---
slug: web-design
title: Web Design Resources
description: Free tools for UI design, assets, and performance-friendly images.
category: Design
date: 2025-11-27
tags: [Design, UI]
---

## Design Tools

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)
```

## Landing Page (Services + Checkout)

- Located at `app/pages/index.vue`
- "Describe Your Service" scrolls to pricing section
- Lists 16+ professional services at $1,500 each
- Features $39 Systems Diagnostic as a quick-win option (positioned strategically after "How It Works")
- Multiple Tally popups for different offerings:
  - Premium Service Booking: `q45GQg`
  - Systems Diagnostic: `jaeo4J`
- The Tally embed script is injected with `useHead`; `window.Tally` is typed in TypeScript
- Content driven by `content/pages/index.md` with YAML frontmatter for easy updates
- Strategic placement of $39 service:
  1. Soft mention under hero (not a primary CTA)
  2. Dedicated section after "How It Works" (primary placement)
  3. Footer CTA before FAQ section

## Free Tools Directory (200+ Resources)

- Index: `app/pages/directory/index.vue`
- Gated by a simple Tally popup form (ID `xXVMRk`). On submit, access is unlocked via `localStorage` key `tradealink-directory-unlocked`
- Once unlocked, users see a comprehensive, mobile-first list of 17+ categories sorted alphabetically by title
- 200+ curated free tools for developers, students, freelancers, and small businesses
- Category pages use `app/pages/directory/[slug].vue` to render metadata and the markdown body via `<ContentRenderer>`
- Categories include: AI & Automation, Business Ops, Career & Freelance, CMS, Document Utilities, Education, Forms, Learning & Research, Low-code Platforms, Marketing, OSINT, Payment Gateways, Remote Desktop Tools, Subreddit Marketing, Web Design, Web Development, and Web Hosting

Nuxt Content runs with `experimental.sqliteConnector='native'` via `better-sqlite3`. No manual DB setup is needed.

## Routing & Prerendering

`nuxt.config.ts` pre-renders key pages for fast static delivery:

```ts
routeRules: {
  '/': { prerender: true },
  '/pages': { redirect: '/' },
  '/services': { prerender: true },
  '/vault': { prerender: true },
  '/directory': { prerender: true },
  '/directory/**': { prerender: true },
  '/blog': { prerender: true },
  '/blog/**': { prerender: true },
  '/template': { prerender: true },
  '/template/**': { prerender: true }
}
```

To prerender additional static pages:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
routeRules: {
  '/new-page': { prerender: true }
}
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pnpm install
```

Start dev server (http://localhost:3000):

```powershell
pnpm run dev
```

Type check and lint:

```powershell
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

Build and preview production:

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

## Conventions

- Prefer Nuxt UI props (color, variant, size) over custom utility classes.
- Use `<script setup>` with Composition API; components in `app/components/` use PascalCase filenames.
- Add new directory categories as markdown under `content/directory/` with required frontmatter.
- ESLint stylistic rules: `braceStyle: '1tbs'`, `commaDangle: 'never'`.

Vue SFCs should use `<script setup>` and PascalCase filenames in `app/components/`. Prefer `UIcon` shorthand (e.g., `i-lucide-arrow-right`). Avoid global side effects outside `app/app.vue`.

## Roadmap

- Add search/filter to `/directory` for faster tool discovery
- Expand service offerings based on customer demand
- Add case studies and service examples
- Wire product-specific Whop URLs and pass service details as query params
- Enhance vault preview with sample resources
- Add testimonials and success stories
- Create video walkthroughs for popular services

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Please:

- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before submitting.
- Follow Nuxt UI component patterns and content schema.
- Keep changes minimal, focused, and stylistically consistent.

## Customization Notes

## YAML-Driven Pages

Marketing pages and the blog hero are fully content-driven via `@nuxt/content` with YAML frontmatter:

- Landing: `content/pages/index.md`
- Vault: `content/pages/vault.md`
- White-Label Platform: `content/pages/white-label-platform.md`
- Blog Index Hero: `content/pages/blog.md`

Pages query the `pages` collection and bind fields like `hero.title`, `hero.description`, and `sections.*`:

```ts
// Example in a page component
const { data: page } = await useAsyncData('landing-page', () =>
  queryCollection('pages')
    .where('slug', '=', 'index')
    .first()
)
```

Common section structures:

```yaml
hero:
  title: string
  description: string
sections:
  whatWeDo:
    title: string
    description: string
    tasks: string[]
  howItWorks:
    title: string
    steps:
      - { title: string, description: string }
  pricing:
    title: string
    tiers:
      - { name: string, price: string, blurb: string, examples: string[], tallyFormId: string }
    includes: string[]
  vault:
    title: string
    intro: string
    details: string
    items: string[]
  directory:
    title: string
    intro: string
    categories: string[]
  affiliate:
    title: string
    intro: string
    perks: string[]
  faq:
    title: string
    items:
      - { label: string, content: string }
```

Bind conservatively with optional chaining and light casting when needed:

```vue
<UPageSection
  :title="(page.sections as any)?.pricing?.title"
>
  <!-- render pricing tiers from YAML -->
</UPageSection>
```

## Blog

Blog posts live under `content/blog/*.md` and are listed on `/blog`. The blog index hero pulls from `content/pages/blog.md`.

## Template Products

The site includes a template marketplace at `/template` with ready-to-use Nuxt UI templates:

- **Micro Task Landing Page Template** ($49): Conversion-focused landing page for micro-task services, prewired with Tally + Whop
  - Nuxt UI hero, sections, and clear CTAs
  - Tally popups with onSubmit Whop redirect
  - YAML-driven copy via @nuxt/content
  - Mobile-first, fast, and prerender-friendly

- **White-Label Platform Template** ($49): Launch a branded micro-SaaS fast
  - Branded landing page and theme application
  - Task catalog with tiered pricing
  - Whop checkout wiring and Vault unlock
  - Content-driven pages with @nuxt/content

Template products are defined in `content/template/product/*.md` with frontmatter including price, features, and purchase URLs.

## Studio

This project currently edits content via markdown/YAML. If you decide to re-enable in-app Studio later, add `nuxt-studio` and its config to `nuxt.config.ts`. Otherwise, keep editing via files.

## Route Rules

Alongside prerendering, `/pages` is redirected to `/` to avoid content-generated path warnings:

```ts
routeRules: {
  '/': { prerender: true },
  '/pages': { redirect: '/' },
  '/directory': { prerender: true },
  '/directory/**': { prerender: true },
  '/white-label-platform': { prerender: true },
  '/blog': { prerender: true },
  '/blog/**': { prerender: true }
}
```

- Update site branding and header/footer links in `app/app.vue`.
- Adjust theme colors in `app/app.config.ts`.
- Replace Tally form IDs and Whop redirect logic in `app/pages/index.vue` and `app/pages/directory/index.vue` as needed.

### Tally + Whop Integration Notes

- **Premium Service Booking** (`app/pages/index.vue`): Tally popup opens with `window.Tally.openPopup('q45GQg', { onSubmit: () => window.location.href = 'https://whop.com' })`. The Tally embed script is injected via `useHead`
- **Systems Diagnostic** (`app/pages/index.vue`): Tally popup opens with `window.Tally.openPopup('jaeo4J', { onSubmit: () => window.location.href = 'https://whop.com' })` for the $39 quick diagnostic service
- **Directory Unlock** (`app/pages/directory/index.vue`): Popup `xXVMRk` unlocks access by setting localStorage key `tradealink-directory-unlocked`. UI state reflects unlock with `useState('directory-unlocked')` and sorted listing from `queryCollection('directory').all()`
- All premium service purchases ($1,500) are processed through Whop
- All diagnostic purchases ($39) are processed through Whop
- Complete handover package is delivered after service completion
