## Core Blueprint

- [Lead capture intake](https://tradealink.org/tools/freelancer-crm#intake) – Embed-ready form that routes prospects into the pipeline with preset scoring.
- [Proposal + scope pack](https://tradealink.org/tools/freelancer-crm#proposal) – Duplicate-ready proposal doc with scope blocks, timeline tables, and e-sign placeholder.
- [Invoice + reminder board](https://tradealink.org/tools/freelancer-crm#billing) – Track sent invoices, payment status, and automated follow-up email copy.

## Suggested Add-ons (Free)

- [Tally Forms](https://tally.so/) – Create branded intake forms that write to Notion via Zap/Make.
- [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) – Free invoicing and accounting if you outgrow the Notion board.
- [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) – Time tracking to reconcile against invoices and retainers.
