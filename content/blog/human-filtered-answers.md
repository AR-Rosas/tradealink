Most “research” online isn’t research.

It’s:

- opening 27 tabs
- skimming half of each page
- getting pulled into Reddit threads
- walking away with a vague feeling… and no decision

## The problem isn’t information. It’s filtration.

The internet is optimized for:

- SEO (not accuracy)
- hot takes (not clarity)
- affiliate spam (not what’s best for you)

So when you search, you don’t get an answer—you get a feed.

## What we do instead

**curateai.xyz is a human-filtered search + answer service.**

AI helps with speed and pattern matching, but the output is:

- checked and curated by a human
- written in plain English
- shaped to your constraints (budget, time, skill level, tools)

## The workflow (2 minutes on your end)

1. You send a question + your constraints.
2. We search, cross-check, and shortlist.
3. You get a concise response by email with:
   - a recommended option (or 2–3 options if there’s a real tradeoff)
   - a quick “why this”
   - links you can trust
   - next steps to execute

## The two most common failure modes we prevent

### 1) Analysis paralysis

If you don’t pick a direction, you lose the only resource you can’t replace: **time**.

A good recommendation isn’t perfect—it’s *good enough to act on*.

### 2) Mismatched advice

Most advice assumes you’re:

- a full-time founder
- an engineer
- or someone with infinite patience for tools

We answer based on your real situation.

## When this is *not* the right fit

If you want a fully custom build, deep implementation work, or something that requires weeks of execution, the answer service won’t be enough.

That’s where the concierge offer fits better.

## If you want to try it

Start with a Quick Answer ($5) to validate the workflow. If you need deeper decision support, move up to the $39 brief.
