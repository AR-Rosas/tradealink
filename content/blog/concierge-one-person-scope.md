When you hear “concierge,” it’s easy to imagine an agency.

That’s not what this is.

**This concierge offer is a focused, one-person service.** The value isn’t headcount—it’s speed, taste, and a bias toward shipping.

## The guiding rule

If it can be handled by a capable solo operator (non-artist), it’s usually in scope.

If it needs specialists, heavy design, or licensed expertise, it’s not.

## Great fits (common requests)

### Nuxt web development (core strength)

- landing pages and marketing sites (Nuxt + Nuxt UI)
- content-driven pages (Nuxt Content)
- lightweight dashboards or internal tools
- cleanup/refactors on an existing Nuxt codebase to improve speed, UX, and clarity

This isn’t about capability—Nuxt is one of the strongest parts of the $1,500 concierge.
The boundary is **project size**: if it’s a multi-month app with a large backend and a multi-person roadmap, it’s out of scope for a one-person concierge.

### Copywriting + offer positioning

- landing page rewrites
- clearer pricing/tiers
- tightening the hero + CTA
- email sequences or follow-ups
- “make this understandable to a normal buyer” edits

### Recruiting ops (lightweight, practical)

- job post rewrites
- candidate scorecards
- interview loops and question sets
- a simple tracking system (Airtable/Sheets)
- outbound templates (LinkedIn/email)

### Business ops + systems

- SOPs, checklists, and internal docs
- automations (forms → spreadsheet → notifications)
- “single source of truth” dashboards
- cleaning up tool sprawl

### Implementation support

I can wire together the pieces and get you to a working baseline—often by shipping a clean Nuxt front-end plus the underlying ops automation.

## Not a fit (and why)

### Brand identity and custom illustration

Good design is specialist work. We can work with existing components and clean layouts, but we’re not a branding studio.

### Legal / financial advice

We’ll help you organize questions and find reputable sources, but we don’t provide licensed advice.

### Massive builds

If it needs a multi-person team (or a long timeline), it’s not realistic for a one-person concierge.

## What you should expect to receive

- a clear plan (what to do first, second, third)
- deliverables you can use immediately (docs, copy, systems)
- optional implementation help to get the first version live

## If you’re unsure

A good rule: if you can describe the outcome in one paragraph, we can usually help.

If you need weeks of engineering or a full rebrand, we’ll tell you upfront.
