## FAQ

### Are the affiliate links included on this page?

No — if I posted all 200+ links publicly, it wouldn’t be a product. This page is the **sales page**.

### How is it delivered?

After purchase, you’ll receive the database in a downloadable format (spreadsheet / Notion-ready).

### Is it updated?

Yes. Dead links get removed, new programs get added, and categories get refined over time.
