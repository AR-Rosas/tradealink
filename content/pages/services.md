# Our Services — $1,500 Each

Tell us what you need, and we'll build the system end-to-end — automation, documentation, and handoff included. Delivery timeline depends on scope: **small systems & audits take 2–5 days; full automation/CRM builds take 2–3 weeks**. We handle the everyday operations most teams wrestle with: bookings that sync to calendars, emails that reply themselves, invoices that generate automatically, CRMs that stay updated, staff notifications, and weekly reports that make your numbers obvious. If you need deeper work, we audit how things really run, clean up workflows, write clear SOPs, set up onboarding, build simple task systems, and give you a KPI dashboard so you can see where things move (or stall).

Beyond operations, we ship focused tools and systems: AI that removes repetitive work, custom calculators and utilities (code or no-code), tidy data setups in Sheets/Notion/Airtable with automations and dashboards, CRM pipelines that actually move deals, appointment pipelines for service businesses (reminders, follow-ups, reviews, scheduling), clean knowledge bases and onboarding guides, lead capture + routing + follow-ups wired into your CRM, one dashboard for sales/ops with automated data pulls, Slack/Discord structured so people find what they need, documented files with real naming rules and backups, smooth client onboarding (intake → contract → payment → folders → kickoff), practical productivity frameworks for teams, and reporting/document automation that turns hours into minutes. Every project includes **complete ownership and training** — full source code/system access, step-by-step SOPs, video walkthroughs, admin guides, and 30 days of post-launch support — so you aren't dependent on us forever. Fixed price: **$1,500**. Clear docs. Working systems. No fluff.
