When you don’t just need an answer—you want the system built end-to-end.

These are fixed-price, done-for-you builds for founders and small teams. Delivery timeline depends on scope:
**small audits & quick systems take 2–5 days; full automation / CRM builds take 2–3 weeks.**

## What you get

- Working system implemented end-to-end (automation, CRM, reporting, onboarding)
- Nuxt web build when needed (landing page, marketing site, lightweight web app)
- Clear documentation (SOPs, naming rules, admin guides)
- Handoff + training so you own it
- 30 days post-launch support for fixes and questions

## Common builds

- Nuxt landing pages and marketing sites (fast, clean, content-driven)
- Nuxt dashboards and internal tools (lightweight, practical)
- Booking + scheduling pipelines (reminders, follow-ups, reviews)
- Lead capture → routing → follow-up inside your CRM
- Reporting dashboards (sales/ops KPIs) with automated data pulls
- Document automation (turn hours into minutes)
- Airtable/Notion/Sheets systems with automations + tidy data structure
- Internal knowledge base + onboarding workflows
- Copywriting + offer positioning (landing pages, email sequences, outreach scripts)
- Recruiting ops (job posts, scorecards, screening pipeline, interview loops)
- Slack/Discord organization so people find what they need
